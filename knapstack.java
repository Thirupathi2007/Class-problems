/*
Container Loading Problem:
Problem
We are given:

A container with limited capacity
A set of items with weights
Objective

1)Load the maximum number of items into the container
2)The total weight must not exceed the capacity

Example
Container capacity = 20
Weights = 4, 8, 1, 5, 12


Read number of items
Read weights
Sort the weights in ascending order
Add weights one by one until capacity is full
Count how many items are loaded

import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        int w[] = {4, 8, 1, 5, 12};   // weights
        int capacity = 20;

        Arrays.sort(w);   // 1 4 5 8 12

        int sum = 0;
        int count = 0;

        for(int i = 0; i < w.length; i++) {//4<5
            if(sum + w[i] <= capacity) {//18<=20
                sum = sum + w[i];//18
                count++;//4
            }
